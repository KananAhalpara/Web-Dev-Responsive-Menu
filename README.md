Build Your Own Responsive Navigation Menu 
No boring quizzes for you this week! You get to follow along a wonderful tutorial with the most fantastic British accent! It's only 16 minutes long and even with pausing I don't think it will take you a full hour to finish. 

Use this starter HTML so you don't have to code it all: Hybrid4-index-starter.html

Helpful Tips:
Don't try to keep pace with his ridiculous coding in Sublime Text (how does he DO THAT). Pause the video every so often to check your code with his. 
Code everything exactly as he codes it before you try experimenting with it
If you get lost skip back a bit and review it 
Do not worry about the icon button he refers to. Your end product does not require any images.
